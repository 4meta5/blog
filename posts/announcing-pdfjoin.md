# Announcing PDFJoin

You're on a plane. No wifi. You need to merge two PDFs before landing. With most tools, you're stuck.

Not with [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org).

## Your PDFs Never Leave Your Device

When you drag your PDFs into PDFJoin, they stay on your device. The entire merging process happens right there. No upload, no cloud processing, no waiting. Your merged PDF is generated instantly, on your machine.

## Privacy by Design

Most services ask you to trust their privacy policy. PDFJoin doesn't require trust because your files physically cannot reach us. There's nothing in the cloud waiting to receive them. The code runs entirely on your device.

This isn't privacy by policy. It's privacy by architecture.

## Try It Now

Head over to [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org), drop in some PDFs, and see what local-first feels like. No account required. No email signup. Just a tool that does exactly what it says, entirely on your terms.
