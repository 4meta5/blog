# PDFJoin Edit Beta

[PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org) now has preview and edit.

## What's New

Preview changes everything. You can now see your pages and click to select them. No more typing page ranges.

Edit lets you add text and annotations. It's beta. There are bugs.

Everything still runs on your device. Files never leave.

## Free

No paywall. We'll use this tech in other products to fund development here.
